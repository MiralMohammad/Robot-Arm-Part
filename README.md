# 🤖 U-Bracket Mount for Robotic Arm


This is a custom-designed **U-bracket component** intended for use in a **robotic arm**. It was created using the **Onshape** online CAD platform.

## 🛠️ Design Steps

The part was created in **Onshape** using the following process:

### 1. ✏️ U-Shape Sketch
- Drew a **U-shaped profile** using **8 connected lines** to form the base and side walls.
- This served as the main structure of the bracket.

### 2. 📦 Extrude 3D
- Used the **Extrude tool** to convert the 2D U-shape into a 3D solid bracket.

### 3. 🔘 Circular Add-On at Base
- Sketched a **circle** at the bottom center of the U-shape.
- Extruded it using the **"Add" option** to fuse it with the existing body — possibly to support another mounting component or strengthen the base.

### 4. 🌀 Fillets for Smoother Edges
- Applied **fillet features** to the sharp corners to:
  - Smooth the part for handling and assembly.
  - Improve structural strength by reducing stress points.
  - Add a sleek, curved appearance to the bracket.

### 5. 🕳️ Openings for Assembly
- Added **circular holes** on the vertical side walls — likely for rotational joints or pins.
- Created **hexagonal holes** on the bottom platform — designed to fit hex-head bolts securely.
- Used **Extrude Remove** to cut through the body with both shapes.
